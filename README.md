### FCC Project 3 | Landing Page

Check out the final result [here](#).

##### Introduction

My third FreeCodeCamp project complete! This time a product landing page, for which I choose to mix my interests and show the awesome Lancia Delta Integrale HF.

##### Challenge

I felt that this project had many small challenged, each one requiring investigating further into different subjects. For example, the fixed navbar, the page layout, and the responsiveness of the images, among others. 

I'm really happy with the end result and I'm planning on coming back to this project on the near future to make some small adjustments and revisions to the navbar.
